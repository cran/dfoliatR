#'Identify defoliation events in host trees
#'
#'[defoliate_trees()] is the starting point for most analyses of insect
#'defoliation signals preserved in the growth patterns of trees. It requires
#'individual-tree standardized measurements from potential host trees and a
#'tree-ring chronology from a nearby non-host species. First, [defoliate_trees()]
#'combines these tree-ring indices by calling [gsi()] to perform a
#'"correction" of the host-tree indices to remove the climatic influences on
#'tree growth as represented by the non-host chronology. This should isolate a
#'disturbance-related signal. Second, [defoliate_trees()], runs [id_defoliation()], which completes a
#'runs analyses to evaluate sequences of negetive departures in the host tree growth series (`ngsi`)
#'for potential defoliation events.
#'
#'@param host_tree A `dplR::rwl` object containing the tree-level growth series
#'  for all host trees to be compared to the non-host chronology.
#'
#'@param nonhost_chron A `dplR::rwl` object containing a single non-host
#'  chronology.
#'
#'@inheritParams id_defoliation
#'
#'@param list_output Defaults to `FALSE`. This option is to output a long list
#'  object containing a separate data.frame for each series in `host_tree` that
#'  includes the input series and the `nonhost_chron`, the corrected series, and
#'  the character string identifying the defoliation events.
#'
#'@return By default this returns a long-form data frame of tree-level growth
#'  suppression indices and identified defoliation events. If `list_output =
#'  TRUE`, it returns a list object with each element containing a data.frame
#'  rwl object of the host and non-host series, plus the outputs from [gsi()].
#'  The list object is useful for assessing the effects of running [gsi()] on
#'  the host and nonhost data.
#'
#'@note Other functions in `dfoliatR`, like [outbreak()] and [plot_defol()],
#'  require a long-form data frame identifiable as a [defol()] object. Selecting
#'  `list_output = TRUE` will trigger errors in running other functions.

#' Composite defoliation series to determine outbreak events
#'
#' [outbreak()] takes a `defol` object from
#' [defoliate_trees()] and composites it into a site-level object.
#' Function parameters allow the user to filter the tree-level series in various
#' ways to optimize thresholds of what constitutes an "outbreak" level event
#' recorded by the host trees.
#'
#' @param x a defol object
#'
#' @param filter_perc the minimum percentage of defoliated trees to be
#'   considered an outbreak. Default is 25 percent.
#'
#' @param filter_min_series The minimum number of trees required for an outbreak
#'   event. Default is 3 trees.
#'
#' @param filter_min_defol The minimum number of trees recording a defoliation
#'   event. Default is 1 tree.
#'
#' @return A data.frame `obr` object for the site that includes all trees in the
#'   host `defol` object. Columns in the `obr` include:
#'
#'   \enumerate{ \item `year` for every year in the set of host trees, \item
#'   `num_defol` the number of trees recording a defoliation event, \item
#'   `percent_defol` the percent of trees recording a defoliation, \item
#'   `num_max_defol` the number of trees recording a maximum growth suppression
#'   (or peak of that event on that tree), \item `perc_max_defol` the percent of
#'   trees at maximum defoliation, \item `mean_gsi` the average of all trees
#'   growth suppression index (`gsi`), \item `mean_ngsi` the average of all
#'   trees normalized growth suppression index (`ngsi`), \item `outbreak_status`
#'   whether that year constitutes an outbreak based on the filters applied to
#'   the function.}
