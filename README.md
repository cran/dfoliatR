The goal of `dfoliatR` is to provide dendrochronologists with tools for
identifying and analyzing the signatures of insect defoliators preserved
in tree rings. The methods it employs closely follow (or in some cases
exactly replicate) OUTBREAK, a FORTRAN program available from the
[Dendrochronological Program
Library](https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/pub/dpl/).

When using `dfoliatR` in a publication, please cite the paper:

## Installation

You can install the released version of dfoliatR from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

    install.packages("dfoliatR")

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("chguiterman/dfoliatR")

## Usage

The package requires users to input two sets of tree-ring data:
standardized ring widths of individual host trees and a standardized
tree-ring chronology from a local non-host tree species or climate
series. `dfoliatR` combines these to remove the climate signal
represented by the non-host chronology from the host tree series. What’s
left should represent a disturbance signal. Then `dfoliatR` identifies
defoliation events in the host tree series.

We recommend that the input tree-ring data be standardized in either
ARSTAN or the `dplR` R package. If there is more than one ring-width
series from the same tree, these should be standardized and averaged to
the tree level. In ARSTAN, make sure to output ‘.TRE’ files and read
them into R with the `read.compact()` function in `dplR`. If you choose
to standardize raw ring widths in `dplR` with `detrend()`, then use the
`treeMean()` function to generate tree-level series. All data input to
`dfoliatR` needs to be an `rwl` object as defined in `dplR`.

## Example

Here we briefly explore defoliation and outbreaks patterns for a
Douglas-fir site in New Mexico. These data are included in the package

    library(dfoliatR)
    ## load the data
    data("dmj_h")
    data("dmj_nh")

To start out, we identify *defoliation* events on individual trees,

    ## Identify defoliation signals
    dmj_defol <- defoliate_trees(host_tree = dmj_h, nonhost_chron = dmj_nh)

    ## Plot the results
    plot_defol(dmj_defol)

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="100%" />

And then scale up to *outbreaks* by compositing across the site via

    ## Identify site-level outbreak patterns
    dmj_obr <- outbreak(dmj_defol)

    ## Plot those results
    plot_outbreak(dmj_obr)

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%" />

## Further resources

Analyses of the tree series (termed `defol` objects) can be done via:

-   `plot_defol()`
-   `defol_stats()`
-   `get_defol_events()`
-   `sample_depth()`

To identify ecologically-significant outbreak events, use the
`outbreak()` function. Various filters are available to aid users in
defining outbreak thresholds. Analyses of outbreak series (termed `obr`
objects) can be done via:

-   `plot_outbreak()`
-   `outbreak_stats()`
